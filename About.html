                Founded in 1990, Alley Cat Allies is a pioneering non-profit organization dedicated to the protection and well-being of stray and feral cats. As a trailblazer in the field of feline advocacy, our organization has been at the forefront of promoting humane and non-lethal methods for managing cat populations. Alley Cat Allies is a staunch advocate for the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) approach, which emphasizes the humane trapping, sterilization, and return of feral cats to their communities. The organization is deeply engaged in public education and awareness campaigns, seeking to change perceptions and foster compassion for outdoor cats. Additionally, we also provide valuable resources and support for communities looking to implement effective and humane strategies for the care of feral cat colonies. Through our dedication, We have played a pivotal role in reshaping policies and attitudes towards the welfare of community cats, creating a positive impact on feline lives across the nation.
