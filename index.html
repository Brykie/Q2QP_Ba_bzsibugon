                Alley Cat Allies is a dedicated non-profit organization committed to improving the lives of stray and feral cats through humane and effective methods. Our primary focus is on implementing and promoting Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) programs as a compassionate approach to managing feral cat populations. Through TNR, we work to control the cat population, reduce the number of homeless kittens, and enhance the overall well-being of feral cats. Additionally, we engage in advocacy efforts, striving to create and support policies that ensure the humane treatment of cats while providing valuable resources and education to communities, animal control agencies, and individuals. Join us in our mission to create a world where all cats are treated with kindness and compassion.
